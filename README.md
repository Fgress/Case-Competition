# Data Science Case Competition - Random Forest

This project is part of a data science case competition hosted by **Women in Data Science (WiDS)** UBC in collaboration with **SAP**. The competition involved building a machine learning model to solve customer retention.

## Project Overview

In this repository, I have explored various data science techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation. Several modeling approaches were tested, including lasso regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. Ultimately, I used a combination of Feature Selection and Random Forest, which achieved 71% accuracy and placed me in the top 3 of the competition.

## Dataset Confidentiality

The dataset provided for the competition is confidential and will not be shared publicly. However, for demonstration purposes, references to the training and test datasets are maintained in the code as train.csv and test.csv.

## How to Use the Project

Exploratory Data Analysis: The initial analysis of the dataset is available in `EDA.ipynb`. It includes insights into data distribution, feature correlations, and basic preprocessing steps.

Modeling Techniques: Several modeling approaches were attempted, each stored in its respective notebook

Final Model: The final notebook, `Final_Model.ipynb`, includes the feature selection process and the Random Forest model that achieved the best performance.
